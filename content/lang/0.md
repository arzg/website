Let’s create a new Rust project:

```-
$ cargo new --lib
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    <path>

USAGE:
    cargo new <path> --lib

For more information try --help
```

Oh, yeah, we need a name. Hmmm. Let’s open the thesaurus and search for ‘language’:

![Dictionary.app displaying synonyms for the word ‘language’](thesaurus.png)

Speech, writing, conversation … _ooh, utterance._ I like the sound of that! Time to check if it’s taken.

![A search for ‘utterance’ on GitHub, showing that multiple projects have already taken the name](utterance-search.png)

Damn, it’s already taken. Maybe I can do what [so many projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache_Software_Foundation_projects#Active_projects) seem to do and use a random non-English word. Let’s try [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto):

![Google Translate showing that the Esperanto word for ‘utterance’ is ‘eldiro’](translate.png)

That doesn’t sound too bad, so let’s check GitHub again:

![GitHub search results for ‘eldiro’, showing that the name isn’t taken yet](eldiro-search.png)

Not even _one_ repository. Fantastic! So, finally, let’s create the project:

```-
$ cargo new --lib eldiro
     Created library `eldiro` package
```
